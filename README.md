# Uncommon VHDL Bug: Incorrect Signal Initialization
This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in VHDL related to signal initialization.  The bug stems from initializing a signal with a value that isn't explicitly defined, leading to potential issues depending on the synthesis tool and simulation environment. 

The `bug.vhdl` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.vhdl` file shows the corrected code.

## Issue
The problem lies in the initial value assignment to the `internal_data` signal.  Using x"00" implies an initialization to 0, but this behavior is not guaranteed across different tools or simulation environments. 

## Solution
The corrected code in `bugSolution.vhdl` explicitly initializes the signal to a well-defined value ('0' or others) to ensure predictable behavior.
